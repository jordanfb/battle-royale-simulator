*TODO*
-Most of everything
-Inventories should have carrying capacity (should be dealt with in the action system already, just not in the component yet)
-relationships
	-requirements and results based on relationships
-hasSeen requirement
	-used for running away, and possibly other things like sneak attacks
-opaque inventory components that hide their contents from item requests through sight.
	-a bag hides the food inside, a sheathe shows the sword hanging in it



Stats the AI has to keep track of, and let's think about how these relate to the goals they should have:
Hunger
Tiredness
Trust for p1
Trust for p2
etc.
Health (HP or by body part)
Fear
Sanity (?)
Squeamishness -- prevents from killing, or lets them be a cannibal
Loneliness
